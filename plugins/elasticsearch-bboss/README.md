ElasticSearch is an Open Source (Apache 2), Distributed, RESTful, Search Engine built on top of Apache Lucene.

This agent plugin is worked with elasticsearch bboss highlevel rest client [BBoss][bs].

[BBoss][bs] is a best Java Highlevel Rest client for [ElasticSearch][es].


If there is trace in the context, add context trace as span event.

To prevent duplicate recording of data by httpclient4 ï¼ŒThe follow two methods have been added to [Trace ](https://github.com/yin-bp/pinpoint/blob/master/bootstrap-core/src/main/java/com/navercorp/pinpoint/bootstrap/context/Trace.java) interface:
```java
/**
     * Pause the trace sampled.
     * In some scenarios, it is necessary to pause the plug-in interception work related to the method internal logic.
     * When the method internal logic is executed, the after interception work of this method is continued. For example,
     * ElasticSearch Bboss plugin as a terminal plugin needs to shield the underlying HTTP protocol plugin
     */
    void pauseSampled();
    /**
     * Continue the paused trace sampled.
     * In some scenarios, it is necessary to pause the plug-in interception work related to the method internal logic.
     * When the method internal logic is executed, the after interception work of this method is continued. For example,
     * ElasticSearch Bboss plugin as a terminal plugin needs to shield the underlying HTTP protocol plugin
     */
    void resumeSampled();
```

pauseSampled/resumeSampled have been used in [ElasticsearchExecutorOperationInterceptor](https://github.com/yin-bp/pinpoint/blob/master/plugins/elasticsearch-bboss/src/main/java/com/navercorp/pinpoint/plugin/elasticsearchbboss/interceptor/ElasticsearchExecutorOperationInterceptor.java)::

```java
 @Override
    public void before(Object target, Object[] args) {
        super.before(target,args);
        Trace currentTrace = traceContext.currentTraceObject();
        if(currentTrace != null ){

            currentTrace.pauseSampled();
        }
    }
    @Override
    public void after(Object target, Object[] args, Object result, Throwable throwable)     {

        Trace currentTrace = traceContext.currentRawTraceObject();
        if(currentTrace != null){

            currentTrace.resumeSampled();
        }
        super.after(target,args,result,throwable);
    }
```
